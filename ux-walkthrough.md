# Project 4 UX Walkthrough  

## Project Idea 
Coco Said So, is the ultimate management app for new models. The goal of this app is for models to track agencies they want to sign with and send in digitals to, photographers they want to work with or help build their books, and a place to track their modeling goals. 

Stretch: models will be able to track their shoots and castings and whether or not they have heard back from an agency, casting, their last shoot, or the last time they communicated with their agent. Users will also be able to upload their portfolio and get a shareable link to send for castings. 

## User Stories 
- If user doesn't have an account 
  - The user will be able to create an account
